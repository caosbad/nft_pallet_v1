# Building an NFT Application

## Architecture

Both centralized and serverless architectures are supported and application creator can decide which one to use depending on how much logic and data they intend to manage off-chain and off-line.

### Server-based architecture

In server-based architecture the application creator manually creates NFT collections and authorizes server to perform operations on each collection. See NFT palette methods that have admin permission level to understand better what server (or administrators) can do.

### Serverless architecture

In serverless architecture the application creator does all initialization and token distribution manually. Alternatively, smart contracts may be used in order to implement some distribution mechanics such as token sales or claiming. The dApp has access to all properties of an NFT token, but it does not have any elevated permissions, since it resides on user site. All operations happen on user's behalf signed by user's private key.
